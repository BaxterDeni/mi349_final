<section>
    <p id="aboutme">I'm Baxter Deni, and welcome to my portfoilio. I am a college student at 
        Michigan State University studying Games and Interactive Media, with the 
        goal of working as a game developer someday. I have a passion
        for creating fun and inventive games, and hope for the opportunity to do that 
        professionally.<br> <br>
    
        On this site, you can view two games I have helped to created for school,
        and I hope you can see that passion in my work. I specialize in design
        and programming in particular.<br> <br>
    
        My background is in Unity and C# programming, however, I also have experience with
        Java and Javascript. <br>

        I hope you enjoy what you see, and check me out on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/baxter-deni-421984161/" rel="author">LinkedIn</a> if you would like to learn more about me. <br>
