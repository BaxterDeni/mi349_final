                <li>This was made as a final project for my MI 231 class.</li>
                <li>The player plays as a worm in a parking lot that must soak up water while avoiding obstacles such as cars and birds.</li>
                <li>I worked on the design, programming, and art for this game, it being a solo project. This includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Coding the movement for cars and bird.â€‹</li>
                        <li>Coding the player controls/worm movement.</li>
                        <li>Creating the health and damage system.</li>
                        <li>Creating the worm's water-soaking ability.</li>
                        <li>Designing/implementing the conditions for the 4 versions of the main level.</li>
                        <li>Creating the art assets.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>This was created for a event in Spartasoft (Game Development club at Michigan State University).</li>
                <li>Players play as a businessperson ascending a building floor by floor by stacking office supplies and coworkers on top of each other.</li>
                <li>I worked primarily on the programming portion of the project, in particular I created:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The player's movement system.</li>
                        <li>A pick up/throw mechanic used to attack objects and enemies</li>
                        <li>The health and damage system for the player.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
